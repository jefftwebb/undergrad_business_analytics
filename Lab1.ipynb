        "In this course, you will be learning to analyze data using the python open source programming language.  Our focus, however, will not be on programming per se, but on data analysis. You will learn just enough programming to do data analysis. While this will give you a solid introduction to python, other courses in your academic program will focus specifically on python programming.\n",

        "\n",
        "For our purposes there is one main reason: collaboration. Using a programming language like python to prepare and analyze data makes every step in the process perfectly transparent to others. For example, suppose I decide to remove rows with missing values (NAs) from a dataset.  That filtering step will be documented in my code. This makes it easy for my collaborators to see exactly what I've done and, if necessary, to correct my work or improve it. Contrast this to how Microsoft Excel is often used.  Usually changes to the data in a spreadhseet typically go unrecorded and are therefore not available for easy review. Using a programming language for data analysis is thus a huge step forward business analytics because it *supports effective collaboration.* Note that other programming languages such as R, which is similar to Python, also work well for data analysis for the same reason.\n",

        "Collab notebooks have a document type of .ipynb, which stands for \"ipython notebook.\" These notebooks are easily saved in your Google Drive (make sure that you have a Google account with Drive enabled) either in notebook format (.ipynb) or as PDF.

Python consists of various libraries that have been created to focus on certain kinds of operations.  We will often need to import a library in order to use a function that is included in it. In this case we will import the `statistics` library. In Python when using a function within a library we must identify both library and the function.
