        "There are many. However, for our purposes we will focus on one main reason: collaboration. Using a programming language like python to prepare and analyze data makes every step in the process perfectly transparent. For example, suppose I decide to remove rows with missing values (NAs) from a dataset during an analysis.  That filtering step will be documented in my code. This makes it easy for my collaborators to see exactly what I've done and, if necessary, to correct my work or improve it. Contrast this to how \n",
        "a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel is often used.  Changes to the data in a spreadhseet typically go unrecorded and are therefore not available for easy review. Using a programming language for data analysis is thus a huge step forward for analytics because it *supports effective collaboration.* This is important because two heads are almost always better than one!\n",

(If you double click the text sections in a Collab notebook you will see the raw markdown code on the left along with the compiled version on the right.) Data analysis occurs within the python code chunks, while the text preceeding or following those chunks contextualize and interpret the analytic results. Collab notebooks are simple to share and use because they do not require specialized software and run directly in your browser. \n",

A function is just a set of operations for accomplishing a task that have been bundled together for convenience. As we saw above, `print()` is a function, but, less obviously, so are `+` and `-`. Python includes many pre-defined functions but we can also create our own functions if needed.\n",

The average of 1 and 2, for example, will be 3/2.) ) The mean turns out to be extremely useful for summarizing, in a single number, what is known as the \"central tendency\" of a sample.\n",
